  abstract = {In a single crystal of semiconductor the impurity concentration may vary from p-type to n-type producing a mechanically continuous rectifying junction. The theory of potential distribution and rectification for p-n junctions is developed with emphasis on germanium. The currents across the junction are carried by the diffusion of holes in n-type material and electrons in p-type material, resulting in an admittance for a simple case varying as (1 + iωτp)1/2 where τp is the lifetime of a hole in the n-region. Contact potentials across p-n junctions, carrying no current, may develop when hole or electron injection occurs. The principles and theory of a p-n-p transistor are described.},
